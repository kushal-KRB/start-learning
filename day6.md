
*AWS 30-Day Challenge - Day 6**

Overview


Today, I completed the "Introduction to Cloud 101" course on AWS Educate by passing the final assessment. With this foundational course behind me, I also explored the options available as I continue to build my skills in cloud computing.


* Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
Amazon VPC enables you to create a logically isolated network within the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

* Features:
- Subnets: Divide your VPC into subnets to group resources based on security and operational needs.
- Route Tables: Control traffic routing within the VPC and to external destinations.
- Internet Gateway: Connects your VPC to the internet, allowing communication between resources in the VPC and the internet.
- NAT Gateway: Allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet while preventing inbound internet traffic from reaching them.
- Security Groups: Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic for resources in your VPC.
- Network ACLs (Access Control Lists): Provide an additional layer of security by controlling traffic at the subnet level.
- Isolation and Control: You can create isolated network environments, which enhances security and customization.
- Flexible Configuration: VPCs can be tailored to meet specific network requirements with routing, access control, and connectivity options.

Final Assessment
 I successfully completed the final assessment, which tested my knowledge of all the concepts covered in the course, including AWS services and cloud architectures.
- Areas of Strength: I felt confident in topics such as cloud architecture, AWS core services, and cloud career paths.
- Areas to Address: I will be trying to revisit some advanced concepts to ensure I have a solid grasp before moving forward.

Key Takeaways
- Completing this foundational course has provided me with a solid understanding of cloud computing and AWS services.
- There’s still much more to explore, and I’m excited to dive deeper into AWS and cloud technologies.
- The journey ahead involves building on this foundation, gaining hands-on experience, and potentially earning certification.

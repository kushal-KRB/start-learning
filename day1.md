Overview
term : On Day 1 of the 30 Days AWS Challenge, I got started by learning the basics of cloud computing. This included understanding what cloud computing is, why itâ€™s important, and some of the key components that make it work. I also learned about the different types of cloud services, the ways cloud infrastructure can be deployed, and took my first steps with AWS Educate.

Cloud Computing:
 Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking software, and analytics.


Virtual Private Server:
 Virtual Private Server is a machine that hosts all the software and data required to run an applications or websites. it is known for virtal because it only consumes a portion of server's underlying physical resources which are managed by third party provider. It can provide secondary storage for data files. For instance,it acts as a file,image, or email server server. It has better utilization and isolation of resources.

Shared hosting:
 In shared hosting, all websites shares same physical server and compete for resourses like internal memory,hard disk spaces, and processing power. The drawbacks of this hosting is that other website that share the hardware can affect our websites performances .i.e. it has limited functionality and has poor ioslation. It is very cheap comparing with other hosting.

Cloud Hosting:
 Cloud Hosting is the process of outsourcing storage resources to a service provider that offers its infrastructure services in a utility model. In most cases cloud hosting is also pay as you go which means the teams pay for what they use and don't have to worry about overprovisioning or underprovisioning resoueces. Cloud hosting allows for freedom to use appropriate solution that any situation requires by instantly providing the parameters of virtual machines across the network .i.e. it flexible. cloud doesn't rely on a single server to store and deliver content, it can be easily scaled to meet the demands of a website or application has scalibility. It provides vital security. It is cost effective as it works as pay as you go model and has high configuration..

Types of Cloud:
1. SaaS- Software As A Service allows users to run existing online applications. It allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go from cloud service provider. It allows software and its functions to be accessed from anywhere with good internet connection device and a browser. An application is hosted centrally and also provides access to multiple users across various locations via the internet.

2. PaaS- Platform as a Service is a cloud delivery model for applications composed of services managed by a third party. It provides elastic scaling of your application which allows developers to build applications and services over the internet and the deployment models include public, private and hybrid.It is a service where a third-party provider provides both software and hardware tools to the cloud computing.

3. laaS- Infrastructure As A Service is means of delivering computing infrastructure as on-demand services. The user purchases servers, software data center space, or network equipment and rent those resources through a fully outsourced, on-demand service model.IAAS is like renting virtual computers and storage space in the cloud.

Deployment models: 

A. Public cloud- Public clouds are managed by third parties which provide cloud services over the internet to the public, these services are available as pay-as-you-go billing models. The fundamental characteristics of public clouds are multitenancy. A public cloud is meant to serve multiple users, not a single customer. A user requires a virtual computing environment that is separated, and most likely isolated, from other users.

B. Private cloud- Private clouds are distributed systems that work on private infrastructure and provide the users with dynamic provisioning of computing resources. Instead of a pay-as-you-go model in private clouds, there could be other schemes that manage the usage of the cloud and proportionally billing of the different departments or sections of an enterprise. Private cloud providers are HP Data Centers, Ubuntu, Elastic-Private cloud, Microsoft, etc.

C. Hybrid Cloud- A hybrid cloud is a heterogeneous distributed system formed by combining facilities of the public cloud and private cloud. For this reason, they are also called heterogeneous clouds.

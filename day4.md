Key Components of AWS:
1. Front-End:
Use Amazon S3 to host a static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Use Amazon CloudFront for CDN to speed up content delivery.

2. Back-End:
Develop a RESTful API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
Lambda functions will handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
API Gateway will manage the API requests and integrate them with the Lambda functions.

3. Database:
Use Amazon DynamoDB as a NoSQL database to store data (e.g., user tasks, blog posts).
Alternatively, use Amazon RDS if you prefer a relational database.

4. Authentication:
Implement user authentication using Amazon Cognito to manage user sign-up, sign-in, and access control.

5. Monitoring and Logging:
Set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your Lambda functions and API Gateway.
Enable AWS X-Ray for tracing and debugging API calls.

6. Infrastructure as Code:
Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and manage your infrastructure as code. This will allow you to automate the deployment process.

7. Cost Optimization:
Implement AWS Lambda Reserved Capacity to save costs if your application usage is predictable.
Monitor costs using AWS Cost Explorer.

8. Additional Enhancements (Optional):
Add Amazon SNS or Amazon SQS for notifications or message queuing.
Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate workflows if you need to chain multiple Lambda functions.
